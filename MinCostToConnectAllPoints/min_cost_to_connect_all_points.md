# ðŸ”¥ Go - Prim's Algorithm  & Kruskal's Algorithm ðŸ”¥ || Simple Fast and Easy || with Explanation ðŸ˜ˆ


## Explanation

This code implements an algorithm to find the minimum cost to connect all given points in a 2D plane. It uses the Manhattan distance (the sum of absolute differences in x and y coordinates) between points as the cost for connecting them.

The code first constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph where each node corresponds to a point, and edges represent the distances between points. It then uses Prim's algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm, to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of this graph. The sum of distances in the MST is the minimum cost to connect all points.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `Pair` struct: Represents a node and its distance.
   - `PairHeap` type: A custom data structure to implement a priority queue for `Pair` objects using Go's heap package.

2. **Adjacency List**:
   - Construct an adjacency list (`adjList`) to represent the graph. Each node (point) has a list of neighboring nodes (other points) along with their distances.

3. **Edge Calculation**:
   - Calculate the Manhattan distance between all pairs of points and add these distances as edges to the adjacency list. This step creates a fully connected graph.

4. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize a boolean array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.
   - Initialize a priority queue (`pq`) with the initial node (node 0) and distance 0.

5. **Prim's Algorithm**:
   - Repeat until the priority queue is not empty:
     - Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.
     - If the node is already visited, skip it.
     - Mark the node as visited and add its distance to the total sum.
     - Explore neighboring nodes and add them to the priority queue if they haven't been visited yet.

6. **Result**:
   - The final `sum` contains the minimum cost to connect all points.

### Intuition and Approach

The intuition behind this code is to find the minimum cost to connect all given points by treating them as nodes in a graph. The approach involves constructing a fully connected graph with distances between all pairs of points and then using Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree, which represents the minimum cost to connect all points.

1. **Initialize Graph**: Create a graph where nodes represent points, and edges represent distances between points.

2. **Greedy Approach**: Use Prim's algorithm to greedily select the shortest edges while avoiding cycles to build a minimum spanning tree.

3. **Sum Distances**: Sum the distances of the edges in the minimum spanning tree to find the minimum cost.

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the adjacency list takes O(n^2) time, where n is the number of points.
- Prim's algorithm using a priority queue takes O(n^2 * log(n)) time in the worst case.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n^2 * log(n)).

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(n^2) for the adjacency list and O(n) for other data structures.
- Overall, the space complexity is O(n^2).

This code efficiently finds the minimum cost to connect all points in a 2D plane by leveraging Prim's algorithm and a priority queue data structure.
