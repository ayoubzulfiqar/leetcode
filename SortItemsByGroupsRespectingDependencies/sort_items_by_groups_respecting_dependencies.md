# Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies

---

## Intuition

The problem requires sorting items based on specific criteria while considering their dependencies. Additionally, the items are grouped, and there are dependencies both within and between groups. The solution involves two key steps: first, preparing the items by considering their dependencies, and second, sorting the prepared items. The challenge lies in handling group relationships and dependencies in a systematic manner.

## Approach

1. **Item Preparation**:
   - Initialize data structures to store groups, checked items, and preparation status.
   - Group items based on their assigned groups.
   - For each item, prepare it and its dependencies recursively. Handle both items within the same group and items in different groups separately.
   - Detect cycles during the preparation process to handle cases where circular dependencies exist.

2. **Sorting Prepared Items**:
   - After preparing all items, if a cycle was detected, return an empty list.
   - Otherwise, return the list of prepared items.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the approach can be analyzed as follows:

- Preparing items involves traversing the dependencies for each item. In the worst case, where there is a linear dependency chain, the overall complexity would be O(n^2).
- Sorting the prepared items is a linear operation, as it iterates through all items once.
- Thus, the overall time complexity can be approximated as O(n^2).

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is determined by the storage required for various data structures such as the groups, checked items, and preparing status.
- The groups list would require O(m) space, where m is the number of groups.
- The checked and preparing lists would each require O(n) space, where n is the number of items.
- The recursion depth during item preparation can be at most O(n), as each item is visited at most once.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n + m).

Please note that the time and space complexities are approximate and depend on the specific input characteristics. The provided analysis gives an understanding of the general trends in complexity for the given solution.
