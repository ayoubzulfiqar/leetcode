## Approach

When it comes to Sum of Sub-array, the use of Prefix Sum is especially important.

Prefix Sum is the sum of the current integer with the previous integer in the array (Prefix).

Example: nums = [1,2,3,4,5] has the prefix sum array of prefixSum = [1,3,6,10,15], where the nums[0] + 1 = 1, nums[1] + nums[0] = 2 + 1 = 3, nums[2] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6, and so on.

Using the example above, we can determine the sub-array sum of any sub-array using prefix sum.

To get the sub-array sum of nums[2] to nums[4] == 3 + 4 + 5 == 12, we can get from prefixSum[5] - prefixSum[1] == 15 - 3 == 12.

With Prefix Sum, we can evaluate if any sub-array sum is divisible by 'k', if two prefix sums have the same remainder of 'k'.

For Example, nums = [4,2,3], k = 5, with two prefix sum, 4 [4] and 9 [4,2,3].

Both remainders are 4, with the sub-array between the prefix sum 9 [4,2,3] - 4 [4] == 5 [2,3], which is divisible by 5.

Prefix Sum & Hash Table

## Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(n)

where 'n' is the length of 'nums'.
In fact, in actual is '2n' as we traverse 'nums' once and the HashMap once, with the worst time complexity of the HashMap being 'n'.

### Space Complexity: O(n)

where 'n' is the length of 'nums'.
The worst case is when all the prefix sums in 'nums' have different remainders with 'k', resulting in the maximum size of the HashMap to be 'n'.

## Code

```dart
class Solution {
  int subarraysDivByK(List<int> nums, int k) {
    // Use the HashMap to record the frequency of all the prefix sum remainders.
    HashMap<int, int> map = HashMap();
    // Note that the integer in 'nums' can be negative.
    // Thus, we need to adjust the negative remainder to positive remainder.
    // Below accounts for both negative and positive remainders.
    // We can also check if the remainder is negative, then add a 'k' to make the remainder positive.
    // For Example, nums = [-2,3,2], k = 5,
    // remainder for the prefix sum of [-2,1,3] are -2, 1 and 3 respectively.
    // We know that [3,2] sum to 5, which is divisible by 5.
    // After converting -2 to 3, by adding 5, it has the same remainder with prefix sum 3.
    for (int i = 0, remainder; i < nums.length; i++) {
      if (i > 0) nums[i] += nums[i - 1];
      remainder = (nums[i] % k + k) % k;
      map[remainder] = (map[remainder] ?? 0) + 1;
    }
    // The result contains all the prefix sum with remainder 0,
    // as all the prefix sum with remainder of 0 is itself divisible by 'k'.
    // However, do note that the prefix sum with remainder 0 also able to form sub-array sums that is divisible by 'k'
    // with one another, which will be calculated next.
    // For Example: nums = [5,5,5,5], k = 5,
    // The prefix sum of [5,10,15,20] are themselves divisible by 5, while also forming sub-array sums divisible by 5
    // with 10 [5,5] - 5 [5] == 5, 15 [5,5,5] - 5 [5] == 10, etc.
    int result = (map[0] ?? 0);
    // The prefix sums with the same remainder can form sub-array sums that is divisible by 'k' with each other.
    // For each remainder, the number of sub-array that is divisible by 'k' is the number of combinations from the frequency.
    // Equation for the number of combinations of n items is n * "(n - 1) / 2".
    for (int frequency in map.values)
      result += frequency * (frequency - 1) ~/ 2;
    return result;
  }
}
```

## Prefix Sum & Counting

## Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(n + k)

where 'n' is the length of 'nums'.
We traverse 'nums' once and the counting array of size 'k' once.

### Space Complexity: O(k)

as we create a counting array of size 'k'.

## Code

```dart
class Solution {
  int subarraysDivByK(List<int> nums, int k) {
    // Use counting array to record the frequency of all the prefix sum remainders.
    List<int> counting = List.filled(k, 0);
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      if (i > 0) nums[i] += nums[i - 1];
      // Note that the integer in 'nums' can be negative.
      // Thus, we need to adjust the negative remainder to positive remainder.
      // Below accounts for both negative and positive remainders.
      // We can also check if the remainder is negative, then add a 'k' to make the remainder positive.
      // For Example, nums = [-2,3,2], k = 5,
      // remainder for the prefix sum of [-2,1,3] are -2, 1 and 3 respectively.
      // We know that [3,2] sum to 5, which is divisible by 5.
      // After converting -2 to 3, by adding 5, it has the same remainder with prefix sum 3.
      counting[(nums[i] % k + k) % k]++;
    }

    // The result contains all the prefix sum with remainder 0,
    // as all the prefix sum with remainder of 0 is itself divisible by 'k'.
    // However, do note that the prefix sum with remainder 0 also able to form sub-array sums that is divisible by 'k'
    // with one another, which will be calculated next.
    // For Example: nums = [5,5,5,5], k = 5,
    // The prefix sum of [5,10,15,20] are themselves divisible by 5, while also forming sub-array sums divisible by 5
    // with 10 [5,5] - 5 [5] == 5, 15 [5,5,5] - 5 [5] == 10, etc.
    int result = counting[0];

    // The prefix sums with the same remainder can form sub-array sums that is divisible by 'k' with each other.
    // For each remainder, the number of sub-array that is divisible by 'k' is the number of combinations from the frequency.
    // Equation for the number of combinations of n items is n * "(n - 1) / 2".
    for (int frequency in counting) result += frequency * (frequency - 1) ~/ 2;

    return result;
  }
}
```

## Code

```dart
class Solution {
  int subarraysDivByK(List<int> nums, int k) {
    int sum = 0;
    int cnt = 0;
    HashMap<int, int> hm = HashMap();
    hm[0] = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      sum += nums[i];

      int diff = sum % k;

      if (diff < 0) {
        diff += k;
      }

      if (hm.containsKey(diff)) {
        cnt += hm[diff]!;
      }
      hm[diff] = (hm[diff] ?? 0) + 1;
    }
    return cnt;
  }
}
```
