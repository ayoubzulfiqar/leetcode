## Solution - 2 Two Pointers Solution

### Explanation

We can solve this question using two pointer approach!

Intuition :

Sort the tokens list.
Pointer i initially points towards the beginning of the list. (lowest power required to spend to earn a point which adds to the score)
Pointer j, initially points towards the end of the list. (largest possible power we can get by spending only a single point from our score)
Why greedy ?

We always tend to increase our score. So, until we have enough power, we keep incrementing i by subtracting the power (tokens[i]) from our current power and we'll add a single point to our score every time.

When we don't have enough power, we'll try to get the maximum power from the tokens array by spending only the least score that we can which is one. Now, subtract a single point from your current score and add the power (tokens[j]) to your current power and decrement j by 1.

Remember, you'll only spend your single point from your score, only when you are sure that you'll get at least one more point from the tokens list. Else, its okay not to play the token. It indirectly means this scenario :

You are out of power. You are left with only one element in the array. Your current score is >= 1. In this situation even if you spend a single point of your score on playing a token and getting power, it's of no use right ? We're just wasting one point of ours for no benefit!!

    int s = 0, e = tokens.length - 1;
    tokens.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    if (e + 1 == 0 || power < tokens[0]) return 0;
    while (s <= e) {
      if (power >= tokens[s]) {
        scores++;
        power -= tokens[s++];
      } else {
        if (e - s >= 1) {
          power += tokens[e--];
          scores--;
        } else
          break;
      }
    }
    return scores;
  }

## Solution - 3

```dart
class Solution {
// Runtime: 607 ms, faster than 100.00% of Dart online submissions for Bag of Tokens.
// Memory Usage: 148 MB, less than 100.00% of Dart online submissions for Bag of Tokens.
  int bagOfTokensScore(List<int> tokens, int power) {
    // play i-th token face up -> lose tokens[i] power -> choose the smallest one
    // play i-th token face down -> gain tokens[i] power -> choose the largest one
    // hence, sort tokens first
    tokens.sort();
    // two pointes - l for tracking face up & r for tracking face down
    int l = 0, r = tokens.length - 1;
    int currentScore = 0, maxScore = 0;
    while (l <= r) {
      // there are 3 cases
      if (tokens[l] <= power) {
        // case 1. play l-th tokens face up if its power <= the current power
        // ---
        // losing tokens[l] power
        power -= tokens[l];
        // and gaining 1 score
        currentScore += 1;
        // cur_score can be mx_score potentially
        maxScore = max(maxScore, currentScore);
        // move the pointer to the right
        l += 1;
      } else if (currentScore >= 1) {
        // case 2. play r-th tokens face down if the current score is at least 1
        // ---
        // gaining tokens[r] power
        power += tokens[r];
        // and losing 1 score
        currentScore -= 1;
        // move the pointer to the left
        r -= 1;
      } else {
        // case 3. impossible to play
        // ---
        // either you don't enough power or enough score
        break;
      }
    }
    return maxScore;
  }
}
```

## Bonus Solution

```go
package main

import "sort"

func bagOfTokensScore(tokens []int, P int) int {
 // to hold the value  of our score
 var score int = 0
 // sorting the token and slicing because sort.slice is more stable
 sort.Slice(tokens, func(i, j int) bool { return tokens[i] < tokens[j] })
 // loop if the token length is greater than 0 abd power is also greater and equal
 // than the first value of the token list
 for len(tokens) > 0 && P >= tokens[0] {
  // we will decrement the first value of token from the power
  P = P - tokens[0]
  // increment the score because we point a score
  score++
  tokens = tokens[1:]
  // if the length of the list of tokens is more than 1 and power is less than first value of the list
  if len(tokens) > 1 && P < tokens[0] {
   // than we will increment the value of power inside the first index of the token
   P = P + tokens[len(tokens)-1]
   // we will decrement the score
   score--
   tokens = tokens[:len(tokens)-1]
  }
 }
 // than we will total score we have achieved
 return score
}

```
