## Solution -1

### Explanation

This code implements a solution for finding the shortest path to collect all keys in a grid-based game. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The `State` class represents a state in the game grid, containing the current position `(x, y)`, the number of steps taken so far, and the keys collected.

2. The `Solution` class contains the `shortestPathAllKeys` method, which takes a grid represented as a list of strings and returns the length of the shortest path to collect all keys.

3. The `directions` list represents the possible movement directions: up, down, left, and right.

4. The `shortestPathAllKeys` method initializes a queue (`queue`) to store the states to be explored, as well as variables for the grid dimensions (`n` and `m`), the starting position (`start`), sets for keys (`keys`) and locks (`locks`), and a variable to store a bit mask representing all the keys (`allKeys`).

5. The method iterates over the grid to find the starting position, keys, and locks. The keys are added to the `keys` set, and the bit mask for all keys is updated accordingly. The locks are added to the `locks` set.

6. The starting state is created with the starting position, zero steps, and no keys collected. It is added to the queue.

7. The method calls the `traverse` method to explore the grid and find the shortest path. It passes the grid, queue, bit mask for all keys, set of keys, and set of locks.

8. The `traverse` method initializes a 3-dimensional list (`visited`) to keep track of visited states. The dimensions of the list correspond to the grid dimensions and the number of possible key combinations.

9. While the queue is not empty, the method dequeues a state from the front (`node`) and marks it as visited in the `visited` list.

10. For each direction in the `directions` list, the method calculates the new position (`newX` and `newY`) based on the current position and direction.

11. If the new position is within the grid boundaries and is not a wall (`'#'`), a new state (`step`) is created with the updated position and the same number of steps and keys as the current state.

12. If the new position contains a key, the key is decoded and set in the `step` state by updating the `keys` variable using a bitwise OR operation.

13. If the new position contains a lock, the lock is decoded and checked if the corresponding key is present in the `step` state. If not, the loop continues to the next iteration.

14. If all keys have been collected (`step.keys == allKeys`), the method returns the number of steps taken in the `step` state.

15. If the new position has not been visited with the same key combination, it is marked as visited, and the `step` state is added to the queue.

16. If no path is

### Complexities

The space complexity of this code is O(n * m * 2^k), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid and k is the number of keys. This is because the `visited` list has dimensions n * m * (2^k) to store the visited states. The queue can also have up to O(n * m * 2^k) states at its maximum size.

The time complexity of this code is O(n * m * 2^k), where n and m are the dimensions of the grid and k is the number of keys. This is because,

 in the worst case, every cell in the grid can be visited with every possible key combination.
