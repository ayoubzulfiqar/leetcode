To count negative numbers in a sorted matrix, you can use a simple algorithm that takes advantage of the sorted property of the matrix. Here's a step-by-step approach to count negative numbers efficiently:

1. Initialize a count variable to 0, which will store the number of negative numbers encountered.
2. Start from the top-right corner of the matrix.
3. Compare the current element with 0:
   - If the current element is less than 0, it means the entire column to the left of the current element will also be negative. Increment the count variable by the number of elements in that column (including the current element).
   - If the current element is greater than or equal to 0, move to the next row (go down).
4. Repeat step 3 until you reach the bottom-left corner of the matrix.
5. Return the count variable, which will contain the total count of negative numbers in the matrix.

Here's a Python code implementation of the algorithm:

```dart

```

You can use this function by passing your sorted matrix as an argument. It will return the count of negative numbers in the matrix.
